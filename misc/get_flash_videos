NAME
    get_flash_videos - Video downloader for various Flash-based video
    hosting sites

SYNOPSIS
    get_flash_videos [OPTION]... URL

    get_flash_videos [OPTION]... search

DESCRIPTION
    Download the Flash video from the web page given in "URL", choosing a
    suitable filename.

    Alternatively if "search" is specified (either quoted or unquoted),
    "get_flash_videos" will search Google Video for "search", and present a
    list of videos to download.

    *get-flash-videos* attempts to support many video sites, therefore there
    is no list of supported sites in this manual page as it frequently
    changes, see the website for a list.

OPTIONS
    -d, --debug
        Print extra debugging information.

    -f, --filename
        Save downloaded file to the specified filename. Usually this
        shouldn't be necessary, as "get_flash_videos" tries to use a
        meaningful name for the video.

    -p, --play
        Begin playing the video once enough of the file has been downloaded.

    --player=*CMD*
        Specify the player to use for the "--play" option. Any occurrence of
        %s in this string will be replaced with the filename of the video
        (appropriately shell escaped).

        The default is to use mplayer:

          mplayer -really-quiet %s

        You may wish to automatically delete the video after you have viewed
        it:

          mplayer -really-quiet %s; rm %s

    -q, --quiet
        Be quiet, only print errors.

    -u, --update
        Check the *get-flash-videos* website for a newer version. If a newer
        version is available download it and replace the running version
        with it. You will need to run this as a user with permission to
        write to the location of the get_flash_videos program. If you
        installed using a packaging system it is recommended to use that to
        upgrade, not this option.

    -v, --version
        Print the version of *get_flash_videos*.

    -y, --yes
        Do not prompt with any questions, just say 'yes'. This means either
        literally yes, or the default or first option if choosing from a
        list.

CONFIGURATION
    On startup *get_flash_videos* will read the configuration files located
    at /etc/get_flash_videosrc and then ~/.get_flash_videosrc.

    The files follow a simple "name = value" convention where the name
    matches the long version of the command line options. For example if you
    want to specify the default player, to always say yes and to always run
    the player the file might look like:

      player = my-video-player %s 2>/dev/null; rm -f %s
      yes

      # Always play the video
      play

    Options given on the command line will override these options, with the
    exception that it is not currently possible to disable an option enabled
    in the configuration file from the command line.

EXAMPLES
    Play a video (may prompt for filename still, override with -y):

        get_flash_videos -p http://some.site/video

    Download a video (note quotes are required for URLs with special
    characters like "&" in):

        get_flash_videos "http://some.site/video?f=1&v=1234"

    Play the URL on the clipboard (UNIX):

        xclip -o | xargs get_flash_videos -y -p

    Play the URL on the clipboard (OSX):

        pbpaste | xargs get_flash_videos -y -p

    (Note if there is text on the clipboard rather than a URL above then
    get_flash_videos will search for it).

    Play the first video matching "Open Source":

        get_flash_videos -y -p Open Source

BUGS
    Third party sites are a moving target therefore it is possible support
    for some of the sites may not work correctly. First check that you are
    using the latest version.
