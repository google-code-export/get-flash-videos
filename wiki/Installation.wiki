Install the Perl modules WWW::Mechanize (required) and XML::Simple (required for some sites). Preferably install the packaged versions of these provided by your distribution. If you can't, install the modules off [http://search.cpan.org/ CPAN] - follow [http://code.google.com/p/get-flash-videos/wiki/CPANGuide our short walkthrough] or read the [http://search.cpan.org/~jhi/perl-5.8.0/pod/perlmodinstall.pod perlmodinstall] documentation for more extensive information.

Note you may also need to install the Perl modules XML::Simple and Data::AMF for support for some sites.

= rtmpdump =

get_flash_videos can download videos from servers over RTMP, this needs rtmpdump. You can get a copy of rtmpdump from http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu. If you compile it or use an unpackaged version you should chmod it as executable and copy this to
somewhere on your PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin). If you have problems compiling, make sure you have libssl-dev installed.

= Using get_flash_videos =
